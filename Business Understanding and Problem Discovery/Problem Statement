**Flower Recognition Web App**

The aim of the project is to design and implement a system of pattern recognition for the Iris flower based on Machine Learning.
Machine learning is the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and pattern recognition is also an important branch of AI.
This project shows the workflow of pattern recognition and how to use machine learning approach to achieve this goal.
The data set was collected from an open source website of machine learning. The programming language used in this project is Python.
After the model is trained, the model has the ability to aggregate three different classifications of Iris flower to three categories.
In the final stage of this project, the ML app will be deployed on web with the help of Flask API.
