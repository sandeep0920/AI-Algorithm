The dataset was generated in 1936 by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher, it is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.
The data set contains three classes of 50 instances each (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica), where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
Each class is linearly separable from the other two classes. The Iris dataset can be used by a machine learning model to illustrate classification 
The attribute information will include sepal length, sepal width, and petal length and petal width. All of them have the same unit, cm


Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica

It is a multivariate dataset with 5 attibutes and no missing values.
